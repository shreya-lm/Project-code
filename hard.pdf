Hard 2 
You are given a string s. You can convert s to a 
palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
Program:
def shortest_palindrome(s):
    if not s:
        return ""

    # Find the longest palindrome prefix
    i = 0
    for j in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == s[j]:
            i += 1

    # If the entire string is a palindrome, return to the original string
    if i == len(s):
        return s

    # Append the reverse of the remaining part to front
    return s[i:][::-1] + s

# Test cases
s1 = "aacecaaa"
print(shortest_palindrome(s1))  # Output: "aaacecaaa"

s2 = "abcd"
print(shortest_palindrome(s2))  # Output: "dcbabcd"
